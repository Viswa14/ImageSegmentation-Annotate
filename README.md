# ImageSegmentation-Annotate
Handy matlab tool to manually label multiple objects for image segmentation.

Image Segmentation is currently a difficult challenge in the world of deep learning / image recognition,
Although lot of algorithms exist most of which are performed on a public dataset that has annotations. 
But, there is no single tool to completely help manually label our own image dataset to create gold standard image or near ground truth images for segmentation tasks, this tool helps to segment multiple objects in a image by drawing free hand contours around each object.

To-Do List <br>
1. Add a GUI to select path for Images/Select particular Image File.    <strong> Done </strong> <br>
2. Provide functionality to select path automatically to save images. <br>
3. Try to add bounding box functionality to extend tool for detection purposes.
